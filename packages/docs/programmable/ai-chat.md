# AI Chat

Press <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>J</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>) to open the AI assistant. Describe what you want — it creates shapes, sets styles, manages layout, works with components, and analyzes your design.

## Setup

1. Open the AI chat panel (<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>J</kbd>)
2. Click the settings icon
3. Choose a provider and enter your API key
4. Select a model

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Models | Setup |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **OpenRouter** | Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, and others | API key from [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, etc. | API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-4, etc. | API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |
| **Google AI** | Gemini 2.0, Gemini 1.5, etc. | API key from [aistudio.google.dev](https://aistudio.google.dev) |
| **OpenAI-compatible** | Any endpoint with OpenAI API format | Custom base URL + key. Supports Completions and Responses API toggle. |
| **Anthropic-compatible** | Any endpoint with Anthropic API format | Custom base URL + key |

No backend, no subscription — your key talks directly to the provider.

## What It Can Do

The assistant has 90+ tools across these categories:

- **Create** — frames, shapes, text, components, pages. Renders JSX for complex layouts.
- **Style** — fills, strokes, effects, opacity, corner radius, blend modes.
- **Layout** — auto-layout, grid, alignment, spacing, sizing.
- **Components** — create components, instances, component sets. Manage overrides.
- **Variables** — create/edit variables, collections, modes. Bind to fills.
- **Query** — find nodes, XPath selectors, read properties, list pages, fonts, selection.
- **Inspect** — `get_jsx` for JSX roundtrip view, `diff_jsx` for structural diffs, `describe` for semantic role and design issue detection.
- **Analyze** — color palette, typography audit, spacing consistency, cluster detection.
- **Export** — PNG, SVG, JSX with Tailwind classes. Vision-based verification via `export_image`.
- **Vector** — boolean operations, path manipulation.

## Visual Verification

The assistant can verify its work visually. After creating or modifying designs, it uses `export_image` to capture a screenshot and checks the result against the original request. This catches layout issues, missing elements, and color mismatches that text-only responses would miss.

## Example Prompts

- "Create a card with a title, description, and a blue button"
- "Make all buttons on this page use the same border radius"
- "What fonts are used in this file?"
- "Change the background of the selected frame to a gradient from blue to purple"
- "Export the selected frame as SVG"
- "Find all text nodes with font size less than 12"
- "Describe the selected component — what role does it look like?"
- "Show me the JSX for this frame"

## Tips

- Select nodes before asking — the assistant knows what's selected.
- Be specific about colors, sizes, and positions for precise results.
- The assistant can modify multiple nodes in one message.
- Use "undo" in the editor if you don't like the result — AI mutations support full undo.
- All layout is recomputed automatically after each tool execution.
